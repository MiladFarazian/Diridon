## Look at Diridon Today
**This was my first GUI-based app that wasn't made with a team or a game**
I was inspired by Spotify's recommendations of playlists based on moods and emulated it with this Java project. Contains fixed playlists based on select moods. Let me know if you like it! You can contact me at www.http://miladfarazian.com/contact.html 

## How to Download
1. Click the **Diridon.zip** and download it
2. Extract it to a folder
3. Make sure the images are where they are supposed to be. Refer to the **Diridon Executable** repository to check what your folder should look like once locally on your computer

## Running the Program
1. Double click **Diridon.jar**
2. Select a mood and click *listen*
3. Click on any of the songs to have them open up a YouTube link on your default web browser
